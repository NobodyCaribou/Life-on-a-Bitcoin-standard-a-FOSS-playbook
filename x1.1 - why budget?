Why should you care about creating a budget?

Becoming your own CFO



Typically, people decide whether or not to spend money by examining their account balance. If you believe you have sufficient funds, you spend them. if not, you don't.

Suppose you have $10,000 in the bank. You see an item, such as a pair of shoes, that costs $150; should you purchase it? The correct response should be "it depends." It depends on how I intend to allocate my available amount.

However, you will typically only consider the two numbers - $10,000 and $150 - and conclude that $150 is a small amount compared to $10,000; therefore, you can purchase these shoes. Better still, if you don't have to pay for them immediately, you can charge them to your credit card and pay them off in 10 installments of $15 each. Most people, if they really like the shoes, will rationalize their spending decision by dividing the cost across multiple installments, so they get a psychological break - it's much better to spend only $15 at a time, it will make a smaller dent in my $10,000 savings.

When you create your budget first, however, the picture changes.

A zero-based budget specifically states that there should be no unassigned money or money without a purpose. Before making a spending decision, a person with $10,000 in his bank account will sit down and allocate all of his funds.

For instance, he will allocate $2,000 to the Giving category, leaving him with $8,000 to assign.

Next, he may wish to take care of his Needs category group, which includes rent/mortgage, food/groceries, clothing, transportation, and basic utilities (electricity, internet, water). For instance, he may allocate $6,000 to this category group, leaving him with $2,000 to allocate.

Lastly, he may assign the remaining $2,000 to his Wants category group, which includes expenses such as restaurants/dining out, coffee shops, vacations/travel, hobbies, electronics, and other non-essential expenses.

Now, he has $0.00 in unassigned funds.

If the same person enters a store and sees $150-priced shoes he likes, he will check his budget before making a purchase. Does he have a clothing budget of at least $150? If so, he may decide to purchase it. If not, he may opt not to purchase it. If he likes the shoes but does not have the full $150 in the clothing category, he may still decide to purchase them, but he will reallocate funds from another category. For example, if he has $100 in his clothing category, he may transfer $50 from another category (such as vacation or hobbies) to his clothing category before purchasing $150 shoes.

Budgeting is an activity that should be conducted whenever you deal with money. When people hear the word "budgeting," they often think "restraint, limitation, austerity, or spending reduction." This is how I've viewed it for a long time, but I've never tried actually adopting it and observing its effects. I attempted to track my spending, but this is not equivalent to zero-based budgeting.

When you create a zero-based budget, you solve for two concepts that are difficult for humans to grasp: opportunity cost and time value of money. How valuable is $10,000? There are an almost infinite number of possible responses to this question. Ten thousand dollars could be represented by ten thousand bananas, each costing one dollar. Alternatively, it could be 5,000 bananas and a $5,000 used car. It could be 9,000 bananas and a $1,000 iPhone. You can also think of it as 10 bananas and 9.9% of the $100,000-priced house or condo.

This is the opportunity cost of money, which is properly addressed by allocating funds to categories that make sense to you.

The second factor is the time value of money, which, in the context of budgeting, means that you should look at your finances over time and recognize that you must plan for future expenses in the present. For instance, if you own a car, you may incur a $1000 expense annually for registration/maintenance; therefore, you should allocate $1000 divided by 12 each month to your transportation category to cover this expense. You may incur expenses once a quarter or once every few years, but you budget for them now using a tool called savings targets.

budgeting means having 100% over your money. it is really about learning how to manage energy, and the first step is to get exact, and start thinking in terms of numbers.

if you are just looking at your total amount of money you have in your bank account, or in your wallet - you don’t have a clear picture on what are your goals and priorities. you don’t want your feelings about money to inform your spending decisions. you want your rational mind to think about your priorities, your needs and your wants, structure a plan and then use it to inform your decisions.

the more time you spend practicing budgeting, the better you will become in managing your money. your priorities and plans will constantly change, evolve as you become better in estimating how much you should allocate in each category. also, the more time you spend running your zero based budget, your capacity to plan in the future will increase.

running a zero based budget also has a calming effect whenever you feel a sense of anxiety around money. it is akin to taking some time to clean up your workspace before you get to work - the clutter and chaos might be the thing that throws your focus off, and a simple tidying / cleaning can get your creative juices unstuck and propel your productivity. your finances are the same, and possibly even more impactful towards your emotional and spiritual well being. zero based budgeting brings order to chaos, and acts as a emotional and spiritual anchor for your life.

if you never created a zero based budget in your life before, the first time you do - you will likely feel like you just got a raise, or that your total money simply increased. people usually report they feel like their money increased by a fifth (20%) after they create zero-based budget. this is because the budget acts as our blueprint that allows our sense of value to get clarified. you will stop “feeling” you have “little” or “a lot” of money. you will start knowing exactly how much money you have, but even more important - how is this money assigned according to your needs, wants and priorities. this is a completely different way of living, and money management skills are integral part of successful living.

your budgets will also accumulate as you create them, execute on them, and start fresh ones. it is almost like generating a journal for your financial life - you will be able to reflect back on your past purchases and get satisfaction by bringing them back to your current memory, but even if you wouldn’t repeat the same purchase/transaction today - you will still get a satisfaction because you just got better at managing your money.

also, running a zero based budget is not something you do once and you are done. this is something you should adopt as part of your adult life toolkits - you will run zero based budget the rest of your life. so start slow, and don’t get discouraged at any point - I am confident you will get a very good grasp of the basics in around 6 months of daily practice. the technique is rather simple, and in this playbook we will break it down into actionable steps, ordered in a specific way.

budgeting is something people have been doing since humanity has awareness of itself. in todays hyper specialized, internet connected global economy running on fiat standard, budgeting as a skill is a rare one to find. but on the other hand, there are tools today that can help you run zero based budget that would put historical kings treasurers and accountants to shame. principles of zero-based budgeting remained the same however, and we are going to cover them all in this playbook.

zero-based budgeting is a skill everyone needs to start with first. unless you have at least 180 of zero-based budgeting behind you, and you are already doing this - don’t skip ahead to second and thirds section of the playbook. you need to start here and get this part under control.

Monetary Energy Management

I want to bring up another point in this discussion: treat money like energy. Everything is energy. As said by Michael Saylor, money is really just one aspect of that.

So really is budgeting is about learning how to manage monetary energy.

You are developing your ability to manage your monetary energy when you engage in zero-based budgeting. You are classifying it into many categories that you can change it into. Additionally, you are managing it through time.

You are bringing monetary energy to higher vibration state when you pull it out of the unconscious. You are not driven by the emotion of the moment when you make a transaction - instead, you are driven by ever increasing awareness of different ways you are able to transform it.

Zero-based budgeting practice in itself is valuable - not a particular budget you make. You don't have to adhere to it religiously, you can always change your plan and reassign your money differently. You can start fresh anytime you need, and you will always go forward in your learning. The only right thing to do is to start practicing this.
