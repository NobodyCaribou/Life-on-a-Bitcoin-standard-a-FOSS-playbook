Why should you care about creating a budget?

Becoming your own CFO



usually people think about whether or not they should spend money by looking at their account balance. if you feel you have enough money - you spend it. if not, you don't.

say you have $10,000 in your bank account. you see an item - for example a pair of shoes - that cost $150 - should you buy them? the answer really should be - it depends. it depends on what other things I want to allocate my money towards.

however, you will usually just look at the two numbers - $10,000 and $150 - and you may simply decide that $150 is very small compared to $10,000 - thus you can buy these shoes. even better if you don't need to pay for them immediately, instead you can put them on your credit card, and pay them over say 10 installments, each time only $15 per payment. most people - if they really like the shoes, will simply rationalize their spending decision by dividing the expense across multiple installments, so they get the psychological break - it's much better to spend only $15 at a time, it's going to make a smaller dent in my $10,000 bank account.

however, when you create your budget first, things look different.

zero-based budget means there should be zero money that is unassigned - or that does not have a job. in this example, a person with $10,000 in his bank account will sit down, and assign all of his money before he makes a spending decision.

for example, he will separate say $2000 in category for Giving, which will leave him with $8000 left to assign.

next, he may want to take care of his Needs category group consisting of expenses such as rent/house costs, food/groceries, clothing, transport, basic utilities (electricity, internet, water). for example, he may allocate around $6000 to this category group, which will leave him with $2000 left to assign.

finally, he may want to assign last $2000 to his Wants category group, consisting of expenses such as restaurants/dining out, coffee shops, vacations / travel, hobbies, electronics, or any other expenses he wants, but are not essential.

now he has $0 money that is unassigned.


in this case, if this person walks into a store and looks at the shoes he likes with $150 price tag, his decision will be informed by looking at his budget. does he have $150 or more assigned in clothing category? if yes - he may decide to buy it. if not - he may decide not to buy it. if he really likes the shoes, but doesn't have full $150 in clothing category - he may still decide to buy them, but then he will reassign money from another category. if he has $100 in his clothing category, he may want to move $50 from another category (for example - vacation, or hobbies) to clothing category, and then spending his money on $150 shoes.

the act of budgeting is something you should do basically whenever you deal with money. often times, when people hear the word "budgeting" they think "constraint, limitation, austerity or reduction in spending". this is how I thought about it for a long time, and never tried to actually implement it and seeing the effects it has. I tried tracking my spending, but that is not the same thing as zero based budgeting.

when you create a zero based budget, you essentially solve for two things humans have very difficult time grasping - opportunity cost of money, and time value of money. how much is $10,000 worth? you can come up with almost infinite amount of answers to that question. $10,000 could be represented by 10,000 bananas, each priced at $1. or, it could be 5,000 bananas and a used car worth $5,000. it could be 9,000 bananas and iPhone worth $1000. you can also look at it like 10 bananas, and 9,9% of the house priced at $100,000.

this is opportunity cost of money - and you solve for it by assigning your money to categories that make sense for you.

second thing is time value of money - which really in the context of budgeting mean you should be looking at your money over time, and understand that you have future expenses you should plan for in the present. for example, if you own a car, you may have for example a $1000 worth of expenses for registration/servicing once every year - thus you should plan to assign $1000 divided by 12 months every month to your transport category to cover this expense. you may have expenses that come up once every quarter, or once every few years - but you budget for them in the present - you do this with a tool called savings targets
