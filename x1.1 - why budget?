Why should you care about creating a budget?

Becoming your own CFO



Typically, people decide whether or not to spend money by examining their account balance. If you believe you have sufficient funds, you spend them. if not, you don't.

Suppose you have $10,000 in the bank. You see an item, such as a pair of shoes, that costs $150; should you purchase it? The correct response should be "it depends." It depends on how I intend to allocate my available amount.

However, you will typically only consider the two numbers - $10,000 and $150 - and conclude that $150 is a small amount compared to $10,000; therefore, you can purchase these shoes. Better still, if you don't have to pay for them immediately, you can charge them to your credit card and pay them off in 10 installments of $15 each. Most people, if they really like the shoes, will rationalize their spending decision by dividing the cost across multiple installments, so they get a psychological break - it's much better to spend only $15 at a time, it will make a smaller dent in my $10,000 savings.

When you create your budget first, however, the picture changes.

A zero-based budget specifically states that there should be no unassigned money or money without a purpose. Before making a spending decision, a person with $10,000 in his bank account will sit down and allocate all of his funds.

For instance, he will allocate $2,000 to the Giving category, leaving him with $8,000 to assign.

Next, he may wish to take care of his Needs category group, which includes rent/mortgage, food/groceries, clothing, transportation, and basic utilities (electricity, internet, water). For instance, he may allocate $6,000 to this category group, leaving him with $2,000 to allocate.

Lastly, he may assign the remaining $2,000 to his Wants category group, which includes expenses such as restaurants/dining out, coffee shops, vacations/travel, hobbies, electronics, and other non-essential expenses.

Now, he has $0.00 in unassigned funds.

If the same person enters a store and sees $150-priced shoes he likes, he will check his budget before making a purchase. Does he have a clothing budget of at least $150? If so, he may decide to purchase it. If not, he may opt not to purchase it. If he likes the shoes but does not have the full $150 in the clothing category, he may still decide to purchase them, but he will reallocate funds from another category. For example, if he has $100 in his clothing category, he may transfer $50 from another category (such as vacation or hobbies) to his clothing category before purchasing $150 shoes.

Budgeting is an activity that should be conducted whenever you deal with money. When people hear the word "budgeting," they often think "restraint, limitation, austerity, or spending reduction." This is how I've viewed it for a long time, but I've never tried actually adopting it and observing its effects. I attempted to track my spending, but this is not equivalent to zero-based budgeting.

When you create a zero-based budget, you solve for two concepts that are difficult for humans to grasp: opportunity cost and time value of money. How valuable is $10,000? There are an almost infinite number of possible responses to this question. Ten thousand dollars could be represented by ten thousand bananas, each costing one dollar. Alternatively, it could be 5,000 bananas and a $5,000 used car. It could be 9,000 bananas and a $1,000 iPhone. You can also think of it as 10 bananas and 9.9% of the $100,000-priced house or condo.

This is the opportunity cost of money, which is properly addressed by allocating funds to categories that make sense to you.

The second factor is the time value of money, which, in the context of budgeting, means that you should look at your finances over time and recognize that you must plan for future expenses in the present. For instance, if you own a car, you may incur a $1000 expense annually for registration/maintenance; therefore, you should allocate $1000 divided by 12 each month to your transportation category to cover this expense. You may incur expenses once a quarter or once every few years, but you budget for them now using a tool called savings targets.
