List all potential budget categories and detail what they encompass

categories are a tool to visualize and understand the opportunity cost of your cash balance. after you run the budget for a while, you will see how your categories look over time, giving you insight into your spending and clues on how to optimize it.

think of categories like paper envelopes where you put your cash in. there is no rules about how many or what categories you should have.

it is helpful to start with the basics - Youneedabudget app has a starter template which has several category groups like:

Bills
  Rent/Mortgage
  Electric
  Water
  Internet
  Cellphone
  
Frequent
  Groceries

  Home Maintenance
  Auto Maintenance
  Gifts

Goals
  Vacation
  Education
  Home Improvement

Quality of Life

don't hesitate to change this and test as you go. don't think of your budget as something that is done once and fixed. you can frequently change your categories and allocations, and  start fresh whenever you want. the main point is to keep doing this, the act of budgeting is what is important.

When you spend money, you must record the transaction in your budget. This means that your categories will be updated after each transaction. For instance, if you had $1,000 in your rent category and you just paid $500 in rent, your rent category should now only contain $500. 




Do not omit entering your transactions, even if you deem them insignificant or insignificantly small. Date, amount, payee, category, and memo should also be recorded for each transaction. Good advice is to be as descriptive as possible in your memo so that you can later obtain rich data from the expenditures you have made. 




Ensure that you enter the exact date of the transactions that occurred. This will serve to track the age of your money, a metric that will increase your peace of mind as it grows.
