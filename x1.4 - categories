List all potential budget categories and detail what they encompass

think of categories like paper envelopes where you put your cash in. there is no rules about how many or what categories you should have.

it is helpful to start with the basics - Youneedabudget app has a starter template which has several category groups like:

Bills
  Rent/Mortgage
  Electric
  Water
  Internet
  Cellphone
  
Frequent
  Groceries
  Eating Out
  Transportation
  
Non-Monthly
  Home Maintenance
  Auto Maintenance
  Gifts

Goals
  Vacation
  Education
  Home Improvement

Quality of Life
  Hobbies
  Entertainment
  Health & Wellness
  
  
don't hesitate to change this and test as you go. don't think of your budget as something that is done once and fixed. you can frequently change your categories and allocations, and  start fresh whenever you want. the main point is to keep doing this, the act of budgeting is what is important.
