Notes from 14.11.22 - random Pavao notes:

you actually want to hold bitcoin during the bear market.
reason is - if you don’t, you will not get benefit from the change in your spending patterns that drop in purchasing power can cause. you can learn a lot from being incentivized to reduce your spending - you will find ways to optimize your expenses so you will get more “bang for your buck”, and this will make you have valuable skills and experience for the future.

think of bitcoin drawdowns in purchasing power (bear markets) as “lean times”, in which you learn how to make the most out of the resources you have.

on the other hand, draw down in purchasing power will motivate you to make more money, simple as that. you will start allocating your time towards building your earning capacity, which only comes from service to others, better. your motivation will intrinsicaly go up because you will be able that you can, by serving other people, actually increase your income to compensate for the drop in purchasing power.

this is extremely powerful psychological force that is in my mind invaluable for building the character and earning capacity, as well as resourcefulness in general.

so personally, even if I knew, say 50% drawdown in purchasing power of my budget is imminent, I’d still not want to “avoid” it by reallocating into fiat. this is because I’d rather spend a year or two going through the bear market, and building my resource management and earning capacity. I don’t want to shield myself from bitcoin volatility, I actually want to embrace it and learn to use it for my advantage.

holding fiat will always lead to increasing my time preference, and shift my spending & earning behaviour. don’t underestimate how this phenomenon infuences your sense of time.

Notes from 9.11.22 - random Pavao notes:

every day spent on a full bitcoin standard strengthens:

understanding
conviction
resilience against volatility
ability to evangelize bitcoin to others

Living on a bitcoin standard doesn't mean you can only get paid in bitcoin. What matters is that you convert your payments (fiat, crypto etc) to bitcoin

Liquidate all non bitcoin income into bitcoin
