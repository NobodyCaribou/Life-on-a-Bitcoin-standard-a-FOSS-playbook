Notes from 6.12.2022. - random Pavao note:

We do not care about the nominal amount of sats or any other currency we possess. We are just concerned with purchasing power. You are most likely accustomed to completing economic calculations in government-issued fiat currency, as this is the practical method of pricing products and services where you now live. This is quite normal, and you shouldn't try to recalculate everything in sats. Remember that we are not concerned about nominal numbers, only purchasing power.

Consequently, when you adopt this habit, bitcoin "price targets" are no longer something to anticipate. You begin considering increases or declines in your purchasing power in terms of percentages. For instance, a 20% decline in bitcoin's purchasing power from $60,000 to $48,000 would have the exact same effect on your budget as a 20% decline from $20,000 to $16,000. It makes no difference that the first drop is $12,000 and the second is merely $4,000; your purchasing power has decreased by the same amount. In the future, if the price of bitcoin decreases by 20% from $700,000 to $660,000, your purchasing power will still decrease by 20%.

In reality, there is no such thing as "stability" in bitcoin purchasing power, as value will always fluctuate based on the total market demand for keeping money. During the fiat standard, until the last person on earth is deleveraged, bitcoin's price fluctuations will be more wild, chaotic, and extreme. When fiat standard entirely disappears, i.e. when the last individual on earth pays off the final unit of debt, we will likely observe a more orderly increase in purchasing power over the long run.Notes from 14.11.22 - random Pavao notes:

you actually want to hold bitcoin during the bear market.
reason is - if you don’t, you will not get benefit from the change in your spending patterns that drop in purchasing power can cause. you can learn a lot from being incentivized to reduce your spending - you will find ways to optimize your expenses so you will get more “bang for your buck”, and this will make you have valuable skills and experience for the future.

think of bitcoin drawdowns in purchasing power (bear markets) as “lean times”, in which you learn how to make the most out of the resources you have.

on the other hand, draw down in purchasing power will motivate you to make more money, simple as that. you will start allocating your time towards building your earning capacity, which only comes from service to others, better. your motivation will intrinsicaly go up because you will be able that you can, by serving other people, actually increase your income to compensate for the drop in purchasing power.

this is extremely powerful psychological force that is in my mind invaluable for building the character and earning capacity, as well as resourcefulness in general.

so personally, even if I knew, say 50% drawdown in purchasing power of my budget is imminent, I’d still not want to “avoid” it by reallocating into fiat. this is because I’d rather spend a year or two going through the bear market, and building my resource management and earning capacity. I don’t want to shield myself from bitcoin volatility, I actually want to embrace it and learn to use it for my advantage.

holding fiat will always lead to increasing my time preference, and shift my spending & earning behaviour. don’t underestimate how this phenomenon infuences your sense of time.

Notes from 9.11.22 - random Pavao notes:

every day spent on a full bitcoin standard strengthens:

understanding
conviction
resilience against volatility
ability to evangelize bitcoin to others

Living on a bitcoin standard doesn't mean you can only get paid in bitcoin. What matters is that you convert your payments (fiat, crypto etc) to bitcoin

Liquidate all non bitcoin income into bitcoin

Create a collective giving endowment? Create a stewards council and list members. Create a minutes book: where are the funds going?

Create a giving playbook (giving is fundamentally the art of effective capital allocation)

Create an art gallery space in RAB? Run a Btc hub out of it?

Idea: Satoshis garden - pay kids to help steward it

Giving applies to every scale - from a 9 year old kid to Michael Saylor
