Notes from 10.16.22 in person meeting in RAB

-

Create a collective giving endowment? Create a stewards council and list members. Create a minutes book: where are the funds going?

Create a giving playbook (giving is fundamentally the art of effective capital allocation)

Create an art gallery space in RAB? Run a Btc hub out of it?

Idea: Satoshis garden - pay kids to help steward it

Giving applies to every scale - from a 9 year old kid to Michael Saylor

Giving section of this document: offer templates and ideas for ways to give. Share giving stories
