What is zero-based budgeting (zbb)

The word "zero" in "zero-based budget" refers to "zero money left to assign." In other words, as the first step, you need to know exactly how much money you have. In the second step, you assign all of that money until there is nothing left to assign.

For example, let's say you have $10,000 in total. You need to assign all $10,000 to your categories. Let's simplify this completely and only use three category groups: giving, needs, and wants. You may then want to allocate 10% to 20% of $10,000 to the giving category, which will leave you with $9000 to $8000 left to assign. Then, you may want to allocate, say, 20% to your wants ($2000), which will leave you with $7000 to $6000 left to assign. Finally, you assign the rest to your needs category, and you have $0 left to assign. This is a zero based budget.

If you then receive a new inflow transaction of, say, $1000, you will have $1000 ready to assign. You then start assigning: $200 to giving, $200 to wants, and $600 to needs. Again, you made a zero based budget.

How does it compare to non-zbb?

Why is it an optimal method?

- A way to optimize resource allocation
- Starting with a zero base (what does this mean?)
- Zero based means that all capital has been allocated and is accounted for
