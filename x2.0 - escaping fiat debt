Why is it important to escape fiat debt?

spirit of slavery / no freedom -> hinders building business relationships because you are conveying you are in in for yourself only. you need to be in it for the purpose of serving your clients. your options are limited, both for the upside and to downside. if you lose or lower your inflows unwillingly, you will spawn spirit of fear which will further diminish your decision making ability and lead to more mistakes. on the other hand, if the opportunity presents where you would increase your inflows significately, but it requires you to take a risk for some time in which you may lower or lose inflows (but gain much more later) - you still can't do this, thus you incur opportunity cost of missing opportunities for increasing your wealth. experiencing this spawns spirit of resentment and loss of hope for the future, which leads to increasing your time preference and thus diminishing sound decision making ability. 

this spirit accrues the longer time you stay in debt.

spirit of desperation - the higher your debt to assets ratio is, the more desperate you are to secure the next payment. this puts the other party in a situation in which if they reject doing business with you, they will feel guilt because they sensed you were desperate. the more desperation you project, the more others avoid dealings with you. 

What is the process of elimination?

there are two good approaches on how to get out of debt, they both center in understanding the dangers debt. if you fully understand the dangers & opportunity cost of being in debt, you will make sure to get out of debt as quickly as possible. the quickest way to get out of debt is to liquidate assets up to the total value of the debt, and paying it off. this is the approach I recommend, because even though it might be the most painful one in the short term, it is the best for the long term, and heals your spirit immediately and enables you to fully embrace third practice: giving 10 - 20% of your money, and moving onto full bitcoin standard.

What is the debt snowball?

this is second best method for getting out of debt - it is used if you still don't fully understand the dangers & opportunity cost of debt, but you are getting there. I recommend starting this as soon as you create your first zero based budget, and run with it during the first 6 months of budgeting. method is simple, you order your debts from smaller to largest, and then pay minimum amount to every one except the smallest one where you focus most of your payment. paying off one debt will fuel you with motivation to continue and build the momentum.

Why this must be done before wealth can be built

getting out of debt restores your natural ability to plan against future uncertainty. as you practice zero based budgeting on a full bitcoin standard your savings will increase in purchasing power over time. however, the increase will not be steady and linear, as long as other people hold debt while getting into bitcoin. being debt free will thus allow you to take full advantage of the times of sharp increases in bitcoin purchasing power, by planning for your future expenses and prepaying them at the discount - thus reducing your outflow rate during sharp decreases in bitcoin purchasing power. mounting debt during increases in bitcoin purchasing power is a mistake that many make, because they are taken on by the emotion of FOMO - but they just incur additional expenses for the duration of the decreases in purchasing power, effectively decreasing the savings rate when they should be doing the opposite.

staying debt free is a different state of mind from which you can make sound money decision across time. debt distorts time perception, and incentivizes you to compound mistakes that ultimately lead to bankrupcy.
