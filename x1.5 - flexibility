Maintaining a flexible and evolving budget

It's critical to remember that you don't have to stick to the exact budget you've set. Budgeting is a process, not an end result. Once you've mastered this skill, you'll be able to create and modify budgets for the rest of your life. People are often hesitant to begin budgeting because they fear losing the ability to change their minds. This is not how things work.

Your budget can literally change on a daily basis. You can make a transaction and deduct a certain amount from the category, then review your budget and decide whether or not you should transfer some money from another category to the one you just spent from.

You can also try increasing or decreasing the number of categories you run. There is no right or wrong answer that applies to everyone. Everyone has different preferences for how they want to spend their money. There are only budgeting principles and good & wise practices that apply regardless of the numbers you run.

Every month, go over your budget.

In fact, every time you make a purchase, you go over your budget. Every minute you spend managing your money will definitely pay for itself. Don't skip your budgeting practice to "save time." You are allocating money as a result of your investment of the ultimate resource that you can never get back once you have spent it - time. As a result, think deeply about your money, and your mastery will grow over time.

As you collect more data, you can change the categories and allocations.
