Maintaining a flexible and evolving budget

Your budget can change every day. You can make a purchase and take a certain amount out of the category. Then you can look at your budget and decide if you want to move money from another category to the one you just spent from. You can also try running more or fewer categories. There is no answer that is right or wrong for everyone. 

How people want to spend their money is different for everyone. There are only good and wise budgeting principles that work no matter what numbers you use. Go over your budget each month. In fact, you go over your budget every time you make a purchase. 

Every minute you spend taking care of your money will be worth it. Don't put off making a budget to "save time." You are allocating money as a result of your investment in the ultimate resource—time—which you can never get back once you have spent it. 

So, think carefully about your money, and you'll get better at managing it over time. You will also get better at estimating your expenses in terms of the time it takes you to earn them. As you get more information, you can change the categories and how the money is split up.
